Intersections
=============

Given a set of "flat" objects (lines, planes), what are their common points of intersection?

"GEOMETRIC OBJECTS" are set of all points that satisfy a given equation (or other set of criteria). Flat objects satisfy a *linear* equation:
  * Can add/subtract variables and constants
  * Can multiply a variable x a constant
  * So: no exponents, no multiplication * other variables
In the real world, these equations generally come from observed relationships between different quantities. e.g.,
  * Two weighted stocks (where 0 = none, 1 = 100%) must together add up to 1: `Wa + Wb = 1`
  * To minimize risk, stocks must satisfy equation `2Wb - Wa = 0`
  * Correct answer is where the two lines (geometric objects) intersect
^ This is called a "SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS", and solving it is "SOLVING THE SYSTEM". A system of equations is indicated by multiple equations grouped under a left curly brace.
