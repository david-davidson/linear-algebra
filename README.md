Notes and Python module from [Udacity's linear algebra refresher course](https://www.udacity.com/course/linear-algebra-refresher-course--ud953).

Covers:
* Vectors
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Scalar multiplication
  * Magnitude (length)
  * Direction
  * Dot product
  * Inner product (difference in angle)

To play with the module, run `python -i vector.py` -- you'll now have the `Vector` class available in the REPL. To run unit tests, run `python vector.test.py`.
