Notes and Python module from [Udacity's linear algebra refresher course](https://www.udacity.com/course/linear-algebra-refresher-course--ud953).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/david-davidson/linear-algebra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/david-davidson/linear-algebra)

Covers:
* Vectors
  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Scalar multiplication
  * Magnitude (length)
  * Direction
  * Dot products
  * Inner products (difference in angle)
  * Parallel & orthogonal vectors
  * Vector projections
  * Cross products

To play with the module, run `python -i vector.py` -- you'll now have the `Vector` class available in the REPL. To run unit tests, run `python vector.test.py`.
